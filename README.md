## Version numbers explained

Starting from the introduction of ExtJS 7.5, versioning logic has been reset and Sencha's numbering support inside this package version has been dropped. Since that this package is not part of any online repository, this change should not create any side effects.

New scheme now uses two digits only: **MAJOR.MINOR**

So, given a number like the above, we will increment the:

1. *MAJOR* version when the ExtJS framework version changes, operation that potentially introduces incompatible changes.
   Each MAJOR version will be always mapped to a single version of ExtJS framework (see mapping table below).
2. *MINOR* version is always set to 0 for now.



| MAJOR version number | ExtJS framework version |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1                    | 5.1.2                   |
| 2                    | 6.2.0                   |
| 3                    | 7.5.0                   |
